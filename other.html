		<p>Some other oddities of interest listed here;</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				If I get back into 3d rendering in blender, I may add some kind of repository of my images on a
				different service. (No renders for now.)
				<br><span class="subtitle">Serving through Github results in a need to heavily degrade the high
					resolution images to allow them to be served on this website and wasn't really an apt solution in
					the first place.
					It will be easier to maintain on a seperate service, but I need to find one first.</span>
			</li>
			<li>I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@conorsnes">somewhat disappointing youtube page</a>.</li>
			<li>
				I mess around with a few <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=DAW">DAW</a>s sometimes.
				My music is uploaded <a href="https://soundcloud.com/css_audio_repo">here</a>.
				<br><span class="subtitle">"Messenger Transit" is my personal favourite track (simply for feeling the
					most polished), but "Mesh" and "Grid" make for good long run tracks. They're all mostly just
					experiments.</span>
			</li>
			<li>I mess around with game engines. I'm currently working with <i>Godot engine</i> using C#.</li>
			<li>Not too much else.</li>
